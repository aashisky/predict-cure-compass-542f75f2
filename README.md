## Welcome to MedTrack

## Overview

MedTek (Predict Cure Compass) is a single-page application (SPA) for epidemiological disease surveillance. It provides real-time metrics, AI-powered outbreak predictions, genomic tracking, and correlation analytics through an interactive dashboard.

## Routing

All routes are defined in `App.tsx`:

- `/` — Index page (renders the Dashboard)
- `*` — NotFound (404 catch-all)

The provider stack wraps the router: `QueryClientProvider` → `TooltipProvider` → `BrowserRouter`.

## Data Flow

- **Static mock data** in `src/data/diseaseData.ts` with typed interfaces (`DiseaseData`, `CountryData`, `DemographicBreakdown`).
- **Client-side filtering** — all filtering (pathogen type, risk level, region, demographics) is handled via React component state and `useMemo`.
- **React Query** is configured for future API integration.

## Dashboard Tabs

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| Overview | Real-time disease metrics, alerts, regional data |
| Predictions | AI-powered outbreak forecasting |
| Genomics | Pathogen genomic sequence tracking |
| Analytics | Correlation analysis and trend visualization |

## Styling

- Tailwind CSS with custom HSL color variables (dark navy background, cyan primary, amber accent)
- Fonts: Inter (UI) + JetBrains Mono (code)
- Dark mode enabled by default via CSS variables and `next-themes`

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**
